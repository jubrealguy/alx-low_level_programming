<h1>Search Algorithms</h1>
<p>This project is about understanding the search algorithms, the linear search, binary search and hashing. Knowing the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs.</p>
<p>Linear search algorithms check every record for the one associated with a target key in a linear fashion. Binary, or half-interval, searches repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. Comparison search algorithms improve on linear searching by successively eliminating records based on comparisons of the keys until the target record is found, and can be applied on data structures with a defined order. Digital search algorithms work based on the properties of digits in data structures by using numerical keys.Finally, hashing directly maps keys to records based on a hash function.</p>
